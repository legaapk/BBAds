## bBAds - Making Some Noise in the BossBar! ðŸ˜Ž

Basically, this is a Minecraft plugin so your players don't get bored! It lets you display all sorts of cool stuff in the BossBar, so everyone can see it.

### What's in the Box:

*   Server Ads: The plugin automatically rotates pre-written announcements. Write something awesome in config.yml, and everyone will see it!
*   Player Ads: Let players show off! If they've got the permission, their message will appear in the BossBar. Control the duration so they don't abuse it.
*   Admin Control: Enable/disable server ads, silence anyone who's spamming, and reload the config without restarting the server.
*   Mutes: Silence those who write nonsense!
*   Curse Filter: Don't let bad words through! Write them in regex.yml.
*   Logs: Record all messages to a file, so you can figure out who wrote what later.

### Commands (for Players):

*   /bb <time> <bossbar_color> <text_color> <message> - Sends your message to the BossBar!
    *   <time>: How many seconds the message will be displayed.
    *   <bossbar_color>: The BossBar color (e.g., BLUE, RED, GREEN).
    *   <text_color>: The color of your message (e.g., AQUA, YELLOW).
    *   <message>: The text you want to show.

    Example: /bb 10 RED YELLOW Check out my shop!

### Commands (for Admins):

*   /bb mute <player> [time] - Silences a player so they can't send messages. If you don't specify <time>, it will silence them forever (until you unmute them).
*   /bb unmute <player> - Unmutes a player.
*   /bossbarad <on|off|stop|reload> - Server Management!
    *   on: Enables automatic server ads.
    *   off: Disables server ads.
    *   stop: Stops all BossBars right now!
    *   reload: Reloads settings from the config.yml and regex.yml files.

### Permissions:

*   bossbarads.use: Allows a player to use the /bb command.
*   bossbarads.kd.15: Allows sending messages for 15 seconds.
